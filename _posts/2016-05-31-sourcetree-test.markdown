I remember the first time I bought a used car through Craigslist, I thought I was saving money by getting a good deal but in the end it didn't quite work out that way.  I bought a 2001 Honda Accord for around $3000 with 110,000 miles on it.  I did everything I could to ensure the car was still in reliable working condition.  I checked out [Carfax][carfax] and saw no history of major accidents.  The seller was also the only owner of the car which was a good indication that the car had not been abused.  The test drive felt good and I was really happy with my purchase, well, at least for the first 3 months.  That's when the car started acting up out of the blue!  Battery died on me, I had to replace the break pads, and one day I started to hear weird engine noises which eventually costed me a fortune to repair!
